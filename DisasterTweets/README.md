# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
*Twitter is one of the main sources of news and updates for many people with a smartphone including in times of tragedy. This is not only due to stories from large news companies, but from individuals who are sharing news headlines or commnenting on a situation they are observing in real time. Becuase of this, relief organizations and new companies are interested in auto-monitoring Twitter to get the latest updates straight from first-hand accounts. With Machine Learning, sifting through thousands of tweets in mere seconds becomes possible. The problem is, as with all Machine Learning, machines do not understand context like humans and therefore have to be trained to do so. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in.*
